Subject: [Dbf-discussion] asking for current offset
Message-ID: <4534CEE6.60601@opensde.org>

hi, what's the supposed way to know the current "record number" (i.e. 
offset) without keeping an external counter? this value is needed to go 
to the "next" record even if we don't care about which record are we on.

thanks in advance,
Alejandro Mery
